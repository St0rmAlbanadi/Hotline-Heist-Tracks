In the en.txt you will need to do these steps in order for the mod to successfully function.

You will see this.

"menu_jukebox_" : " ",

"menu_jukebox_screen_ " : " 

Enter whatever you please for these. (Keep it simple) for the both the menu_jukebox and screen,
you can typr whatever you would like but keep in mind to use underscores when identifying a space.
For example,

"menu_jukebox_tutorial_lol"
"menu_jukebox_screen_tutorial_lol" : "

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add the exact same thing to the end of the "menu_jukebox_screen_"

In the end quatations where it says "Tutorial" This is where you will see the name in the track in the
settings of Payday 2. Once again, do whatever you please no restrictions.

For example,

"menu_jukebox_tutorial_lol" : "Tutorial Lol",
"menu_jukebox_screen_tutorial_lol" : "Tutorial Lol"

*REMEMBER TO CLOSE ALL QUOTATION MARKS* Without closing them the mod will still run successfully however
in the settings when clicking on the sound it will say ERROR.

Once you have completed these steps remember to save and you have finished.
